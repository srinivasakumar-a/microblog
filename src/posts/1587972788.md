‪If you write to get lots of views, your posts will probably never be great.‬

‪If you write really good content, though, you’ll achieve the former by proxy. ‬

‪It’s all about patience. So many of my old articles did nothing, but I’m a completely different and much better writer now for persisting.‬

‪I can also link pretty much all success in the web world back to writing.  Publishing on my old blog has been endlessly useful too. ‬

‪The blog platforms will get you short term views, sure, but what happens to your hard when they’re gone? ‬

Lastly: anyone can be a great writer. I did terrible at school, but over the last five or six years, I’ve persisted and improved. You just gotta work at this stuff, like anything else.
